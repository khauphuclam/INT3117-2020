# Section 8.5-4

# Redraw Figure 8.7 to have fewer transitions, but more clauses. Specifically, nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5 each has four transitions to node 3. Rewrite these transitions to have only one transition from each of nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5 to node 3, and the clauses are connected by ORs. Then derive tests to satisfy CACC for the four resulting predicates. (You can omit the other predicates.) How do these tests compare with the tests derived from the original graph?
