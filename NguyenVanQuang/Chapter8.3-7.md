### Answer the following questions for the program fragments below:
### (a) Give a GACC test set for fragment **P**. (Note that GACC, CACC, and RACC yield identical test sets for this example.)
Bộ kiểm thử GACC cho mảng **P**: (T,F,F), (F,T,F), (F,F,T), (F,F,F).
### (b) Does the GACC test set for fragment **P** satisfy Edge Coverage on fragment **Q**?
Bộ kiểm thử thỏa mãn GACC cho **P** cũng thỏa mãn độ phủ cạnh EC cho **Q**.
### (c) Write down an Edge Coverage test set for fragment **Q**. Make your test set include as few tests from the GACC test set as possible
Bộ kiểm thử bao phủ cạnh EC cho **Q**: (T,T,T), (F,T,F), (F,F,T), (F,F,F).
